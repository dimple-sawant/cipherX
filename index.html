						</h3>
						<p>
							Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text
							characters as standardized sequences of two different signal
							durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is
							named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the
							system adopted for electrical telegraphy.

						</h3>
						<p>
							In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher,
							the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the
							simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type
							of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is
							replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the
							alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced
							by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after
							Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

						</h3>
						<p>
							ROT13 (Rotate13, "rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated
							ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a
							letter with the 13th letter after it in the latin alphabet. ROT13
							is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in
							ancient Rome.
